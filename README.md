# ComputerSignals
This mod is an example of several signals I use on my combinator creations.
The signals are from 4 color groups: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue. Within each color group are symbols for numbers, letters, roboport statistics for robots available and total for each type and signals for each binary bit in a byte. They are in a new signal category.
